# An Exploration into the Performance of NoSQL Databases, Neo4j and MongoDB, alongside Oracle Database

In this paper we tried to observe the performance analysis between Oracle, MongoDB and Neo4J. We have used "pokec" dataset from SNAP. We have choosen the queries in such a fashion so that all 3 of the Databases can get equal preferences. This paper was published on IEEE SouthEastCon 2017.
